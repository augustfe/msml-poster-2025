# Pseudo-Hamiltonian Neural Networks 2: Electric Boogaloo

Now we only need to get math working.

$$
\begin{align*}
    E &= mc^2 \\
    e^{i \pi} + 1 &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

It works, locally atleast.

By pseudo-Hamiltonian PDEs, we refer to the class of partial differential equations that can be written on the form

$$
    u_t = S \frac{\delta\mathcal{H}}{\delta u}[u] - R \frac{\delta\mathcal{V}}{\delta u}[u] + f.
$$

Does inline math like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ work?
