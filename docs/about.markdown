## About This Research

This poster presents an extension to **Pseudo-Hamiltonian Neural Networks (PHNNs)** for learning and solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in two spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension.
The method builds on the original PHNN framework, which integrates machine learning with mathematical descriptions of physical systems to ensure conservation laws are respected.

The methods implemented here will be made available in the [phlearn GitHub repository](https://github.com/SINTEF/pseudo-hamiltonian-neural-networks).
